* Crypto to break

** Password database that sucks + password reuse
Realistic :) "Strong" database: per-user salt + SHA-256, to emphasize its brokenness.

** CTR mode with small counter: either huge nonce or small block size

** Old SSLv2 machine, MITM the handshake, brute force the key

** BEAST/CRIME attack based on compression
** RSA without padding + weak public exponent, message sent to multiple people
** DSA with reused k
*** Totally bogus: always uses same k
*** Kinda bogus: poor PRNG
** Backdoor your own version of Dual_EC_DRBG
** PRNG based on timeofday, maybe pid, other shitty entropy sources
